# ShopTrack

ShopTrack is a marketplace-inspired e-commerce app that allows users to purchase from one another, create stores, upload products, and track their orders. This app is a project for a Software Design course.

## The Approach
After a brief session of brainstorming our team decided to focus on sustainability. From there we started researching and discussing about all the different niches for which we can possibly create an effective solution. Building upon that we came up with the idea for SustainU and went ahead with it because of how feasible yet impactful the concept can actually be. It requires a very minimal start up cost and little to no maintenance.<br>
<br>
The prototype of the app was built from scratch on Figma. Our team spent hours working on the designs, colors, fonts, and the overall UI experience. Although not yet fully polished, this prototype clearly demonstrates the workflow and UI of the app, while taking all the core concepts of design into consideration.<br>
<br>
The website is made to briefly describe our app and what it does, while providing a slideshow showing the basic working of the app. This website was built using HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript, and is really just for showing the world what SustainU is all about. We tackled with a lot of issues related to the layout and bugs during the development process, all of which were solved using research, discussions and critical thinking.

## Functionality
### Basic Working:
- Download the ShopTrack app
- Users are asked to Login or Sign Up with their email and choose between being a vendor or seller
- Create and/or Con

### Earning Points:
- Water dispensing station where you can use reusable water bottle and scan for points.
- Using reusable containers at cafeteria instead of taking paper of plastic plates.
- Gain points for buying eco-friendly products from the bookstore.
- Volunteering in activites such as planting trees in a student-run garden, river and park cleanups.
- Earn additional points by having a 7-day streak.

### Using Points:
<strong>Redeem</strong> : Points can be redeemed from the app directly as cashback or as discounts from stores on campus. <br>
<strong>Donate</strong> : Points can be used to donate for environmental causes to NGOs such as Greenpeace and World Wildlife Fund.

### Gamification:
This app incorporates various concepts and strategies and gamification is one of the major ones. It includes a leaderboard page that shows the list of students who gained the most points throughout the semester. Apart from this, it has weekly streaks for additional rewards and weekly recommended events. Moreover, it also displays positive reinforcement messages that show up on the Home Page, that keeps the user motivated. Competing with other players and getting a reward at the end of the semester is something everyone would look forward to, and try to achieve, which makes it all the more important during the development process.

## Design and Prototype
Over the course of the last 24hrs, we built a design prototype of what the app will look like and how the interaction would be. A video demonstration of it can be accessed on the [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/sustainu-app). Moreover, we also built a website which is directly hosted from this repository using Github Pages and can be accessed [here](https://kritgrover.github.io/htv-sustainu/). Here are a few snapshots of the app.

## Demo
As the cost of gas continues to fluctuate individuals are turning to use public transit. But, shouldn't they be rewarded for choosing this service and leaving a lower individual carbon footprint? <br>
