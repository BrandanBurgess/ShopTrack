# ShopTrack

ShopTrack is an Android native marketplace-inspired mobile app that allows users to purchase from one another, create stores, upload products, and track their orders. This app is a project for a Software Design course.

## The Approach
After a brief session of brainstorming our team decided to focus on sustainability. From there we started researching and discussing about all the different niches for which we can possibly create an effective solution. Building upon that we came up with the idea for SustainU and went ahead with it because of how feasible yet impactful the concept can actually be. It requires a very minimal start up cost and little to no maintenance.<br>
<br>
The prototype of the app was built from scratch on Figma. Our team spent hours working on the designs, colors, fonts, and the overall UI experience. Although not yet fully polished, this prototype clearly demonstrates the workflow and UI of the app, while taking all the core concepts of design into consideration.<br>
<br>
The website is made to briefly describe our app and what it does, while providing a slideshow showing the basic working of the app. This website was built using HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript, and is really just for showing the world what SustainU is all about. We tackled with a lot of issues related to the layout and bugs during the development process, all of which were solved using research, discussions and critical thinking.

## Demo
Below is an example of creating a new store as a vendor, ordering from that store as a user and fulfilling the order from the vendor side. <br>
